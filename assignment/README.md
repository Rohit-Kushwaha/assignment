# assignment

In this project I used BLOC as a state management.

For architecture it's a simple app so do not need to use any MVVM and MVC as of now.

I used some third party libraries like 
=> http => A simple HTTP client for Dart, used for making network requests to REST APIs
=> hive_flutter => Adds Flutter-specific features to Hive, like initialization support
=> hive => Lightweight and fast NoSQL database for storing data locally on devices
=> flutter_bloc: Integrates BLoC with Flutter, providing widgets that make it easier to use BLoC 
architecture in Flutter apps.

=> equatable => Simplifies comparison between objects, making it easier to handle state updates in BLoC by comparing state objects.

=> bloc => Provides a predictable state management solution using BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern to separate business logic from UI in Flutter applications.

=> connectivity_plus => Allows monitoring of network connectivity status changes (e.g., WiFi, mobile data) and helps handle online/offline scenarios.

=> build_runner => A tool for running code generation tasks.
=> hive_generator => Generates type adapters for custom Hive objects
